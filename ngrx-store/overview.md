# Overview

Testing ngrx is mostly straight forward with a bit complexity in the testing of effects. Actions are not tested since they don't have much to test with but If you feel to do it, it is mostly straight forward we can do that referring other tests.

store service and api service are also not considered for testing since they don't do much themselves internally.

Most of the store testing is done on effects, reducers, selectors.

In the next sections we will go through each of them individually
